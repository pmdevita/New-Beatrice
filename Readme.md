# New Beatrice

This is a rewrite of my Discord bot [Beatrice](https://github.com/pmdevita/Beatrice) using 
[hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) and [atsume](https://github.com/pmdevita/hikari-atsume).

Atsume was born out of some unhappiness with my less-than-stellar integration of Ormar with Discord.py/Nextcord and
the way Discord.py/Nextcord handled hybrid message and slash commands. My hope is that it improves 
organization and modularity of the bot and speeds up future development and maintenance.

## Rewrite roadmap

I'm planning to port most cogs but there are a few that aren't used any more and will be dropped.
